## Onboarding:

We use React Joyride for the onboarding.

- To highlight only one of the buttons, we use Button.js and we place a span for Joyride in the button with that text.

- To only show the tour the first time, we use the prop run and a callback function

- When we use disableBeacon on every step, we have no beacon but it obligues us to follow every step.

- When you clicked the close button, a beacon appeared and we were not able to take it away. Thus, the solution was to not render the close button of the onboarding, as we have the skip button which does the same.

Localstorage: we have to give it an initial value.


Corrected:
1. No beacon (the red dot)
2. 4ยบ step only appears in the report button
3. The tour only renders the first time.
4. Names of buttons are changed to spanish

## Map:


In order to change the icon, we place a new icon called punteroMapa in the file config.json instead of the smart-logo.


## Retry button in Report form:

- We use error to see if an error occurred in sendReport.

- We create a new retry button and show it when when an error occurs, not showing the end one.

- We show an info dialog with the retry button thanks to a hook called showInfoDialogRetry and error. Both have to be true for the dialog to appear. The hook is set to true every time you start the second part of the report, hence the infodialog is only shown once for every retry: open={showInfoDialogRetry && error}


## Sticky heading in CardList:

In modaltitle, change css to be sticky and top 0.
We put the title in a grid with className in order to have a white opaque background. We had changed the padding of the container.

## Coordinates of barcelona:

Changed by looking the correct ones in google.

## Bug: when in the report we pressed enter, the report was sent:

We include an e in useForm: 
const submit = (e, queryFcn, payload) => e => {


## Google Sheet for contanting organizations:

- We use sheet.best: allows us to take our Google Sheet data and export it as a JSON object. COnects with the google sheet.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w2J9DuzFHkUmBQ0zHHY51gPY7NRzmbdUV_VckSfhbSA/edit#gid=0
The key is this link.

We need to have the sheet public for everyone with the url.


In order to render and filter by job and region: we use the function filter 
We use includes in the jobs because we can have more than one job in the sheet for one organization. 

- PROBLEM: sheet.best only allows 250 views. Change of plans

We use https://dev.to/calvinpak/how-to-read-write-google-sheets-with-react-193l
We create a google account that will have access to the google sheet: 
p2psheet@p2psheet.iam.gserviceaccount.com 


npm install googleapis
npm install  google-spreadsheet

New file googleSheetCredentials.json with credentials

https://console.developers.google.com/

Need to use useEffect and hooks for async
