## Instalation and setup (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)

In order to setup and run the front-end in developement state run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/p2pmodels/wallofshame-frontend
$ cd wallofshame-frontend
$ git checkout develop
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

A new tab in your default browser should open automatically.
